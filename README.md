## Second homework
I used ReactJS and TypeScript to do this Homework, also it was HTML and CSS, see it in the lab1hw-react (THIS IS MY FINAL SUBMISSION).

The second homework based on the same site as the first one, due to this reason the name of the folder didn't change.
You can see my weather app implementation in weather tab (in top-side main menu). Grid is used in homepage, and flex is 
used in weather page.
