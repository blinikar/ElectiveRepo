# ElectiveRepo
Repo for frontend course elective

You can find here labs and homeworks, I use it to submit my works and for CD.

## First homework
I used ReactJS and TypeScript to do this Homework, also it was HTML and CSS, see it in the lab1hw-react (THIS IS MY FINAL SUBMISSION).
Deployed: https://lively-pavlova-ba07fd.netlify.app/

## Second homework
I used ReactJS and TypeScript to do this Homework, also it was HTML and CSS, see it in the lab1hw-react (THIS IS MY FINAL SUBMISSION).

The second homework based on the same site as the first one, due to this reason the name of the folder didn't change.
You can see my weather app implementation in weather tab (in top-side main menu). Grid is used in homepage, and flex is 
used in weather page.

Deployed: https://lively-pavlova-ba07fd.netlify.app/weather

## Third homework
I used GitHub Actions to build and deploy my site to https://blinikar.github.io

The third homework based on the same site as the first and second ones, due to this reason the name of the folder didn't change.
Types and checking already was in the previous assignment. Check src/components/Weather/Weather.tsx

Deployed: https://blinikar.github.io/

## Fourth homework
This is an overkill to rebuild my website using Svelte, so I created entirely new.

You can find a solution in lab4hw-svelte/application folder

You need to build it using npm
Not deployed
